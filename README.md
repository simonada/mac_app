# My Art Cave App

The purpose of this App is to improve and enhance a person's interaction with Art. It aims at enabling two main functionalities:
1. Allow the user to track the art works that he/she encounters over time and allow to answer questions like:
- Which art works have I seen in which galleries? 
- How do the works that I've seen/liked relate to each other (e.g. based on art period, art school)?
- Which artists/art movements have I seen most often?
2. Allow the users to enhance their art experience through Machine Learning, e.g. by using the following functionalities:
- Generate a poem from an image (ref. https://github.com/researchmm/img2poem)
